```bash
#get the latest code from your repo
$ git pull
# create a branch and move to it
$ git branch <branch-name>
#Create code change
$ git add .
$ git commit -m <your message>
#push code to remote in new branch
$ git push --set-upstream origin feat
```

This will create your code change in a branch on the remote repository.

This will allow you to create a "pull request" which is the review process for the new code to be merged into the master branch.

The pull request can be done inside github.
